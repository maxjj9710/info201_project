Section AE

### **Describe your domain of interest**
- Air quality across the state of Washington, looking specifically at income inequality and sources of pollution.

### **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
- Air quality affects everyone in ways we might not realize, and the regulations in place are often skewed to favor those with a higher socioeconomic status. Clean air is a right.

### **What other examples of data-driven projects have you found related to this field/domain? (Share *at least 3*)**
- [Washington State Department of Ecology](https://ecology.wa.gov/)
- [Washington State Department of Health ](https://www.doh.wa.gov/CommunityandEnvironment/AirQuality/OutdoorAir)

### **What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this field/domain? (Share *at least 3*)**
1. Air quality as it relates to income level
2. Major sources of pollution
3. Where and how air quality has improved

### **Identify, download, and describe at *least 3* datasets related to this field/domain**
1. [Washington's Air Monitoring Network](https://enviwa.ecology.wa.gov/home/map)
    - Collected by the Washington State Department of Ecology, via air monitoring sites and aggregated from local monitoring stations from independent sources.
    - There are 8760 obervations and 6 features.
    - Used to answer: Air quality across multiple locations in Washington and types of pollution.

2. [U.S. Pollution Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution?select=pollution_us_2000_2016.csv)
    - Data is originally pulled from the U.S. EPA database, reshaped by the host to make it easier for data-scientists to analyze the data. The data deals with four major pollutants in the U.S.
    - There are about 1.4 million observations and 28 features.
    - Used to answer: Pollution levels across the US and the types of major pollutants.

3. [Washington Counties by Population](https://www.washington-demographics.com/counties_by_population)
    - The data is collected by the United States Census Bureau and hosted by Cubit. It contains annual estimates of resident population from April 2010 to July 2019.
    - There are 39 observations and 2 features.
    - Used to answer: Where population is most dense and how that affects air quality.

4. [WA Annual Air Quality Index by County](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html)
    - Data is collected by the U.S. EPA, and contains an annual summary of air quality by U.S. county using the AirNow ratings.
    - There are around 1000 observations per year and 19 features.
    - Used to answer: How and where air quality in Washington has changed.

5. [GDP of the Federal State of Washington from 2000 to 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188145/gdp-of-the-us-federal-state-of-washington-since-1997/)
    - The data is collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and includes the change in GDP from 2000 to 2019 for the state of WA.
    - There are 20 observations and 2 features.
    - Used to answer: How is GDP related to air quality.
