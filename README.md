# INFO 201 A/AE Project Proposal

Group 5: Vriana Gatdula, Rona Guo, Aubrey Jones, Max Wang

### **Describe your field/domain of interest**
- Air quality across Washington (state), looking specifically at income inequality and sources of pollution

### **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
- Air quality affects everyone in ways we might not realize, and the regulations in place are often skewed to favor those with a higher socioeconomic status. Clean air is a right.

### **What other examples of data-driven projects have you found related to this field/domain? (Share _at least 3_)**
- [Washington State Department of Ecology](https://ecology.wa.gov/)

### **What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this field/domain? (Share _at least 3_)**
1. Air quality as it relates to income level
2. Major sources of pollution
3. Where and how air quality has improved

### **Identify, download, and describe at _least 3_ datasets related to this field/domain**
1. [Washington's Air Monitoring Network](https://enviwa.ecology.wa.gov/home/map)
    - Collected by the Washington State Department of Ecology via air monitoring sites and aggregated from local monitoring stations from independent sources
    - 8760 observations, 6 features
    - Used to answer: Air quality across multiple locations in Washington and types of pollution

2. [U.S. Pollution Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution?select=pollution_us_2000_2016.csv)
    - The data was originally pulled from the United States Environmental Protection Agency database then reshaped by the host to make it easier for data scientists to analyze. It deals with four major pollutants in the United States.
    - About 1.4 million observations, 28 features
    - Used to answer: Pollution levels across the U.S. and the types of major pollutants

3. [Washington Counties by Population](https://www.washington-demographics.com/counties_by_population)
    - The data was collected by the United States Census Bureau and hosted by Cubit. It contains annual estimates of resident population from April 2010 to July 2019.
    - 39 observations, 2 features
    - Used to answer: Where population is most dense and how it affects air quality

4. [WA Annual Air Quality Index by County](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html)
    - Collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and contains an annual summary of air quality by United States counties using AirNow ratings
    - About 1000 observations per year, 19 features
    - Used to answer: Where and how air quality in Washington has changed

5. [Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Federal State of Washington from 2000 to 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188145/gdp-of-the-us-federal-state-of-washington-since-1997/)
    - Collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and includes the change in real GDP from 2000 to 2019 for Washington
    - 20 observations, 2 features
    - Used to answer: How GDP is related to air quality
